# Advanced Topics

The remaining sections are deeper or more directional. You do **not** need to study all of them. Pick 1–3 tracks that match your interests, career goals, or the type of nonprofit work you want to do.

- **Programs, Evaluation, and Impact**  
  Best for people interested in designing, running, and measuring the actual programs and services nonprofits deliver.

- **Strategy, Leadership, and Organizational Change**  
  Ideal if you want to understand (or eventually become) an executive director, lead major change, or help organizations grow and adapt.

- **Specialized and Adjacent Domains**  
  This is a collection of focused topics. Choose the ones most relevant to you:  

  - Volunteer Management: organizations that rely heavily on volunteers  
  - Advocacy, Public Policy, and Government Relations: policy change or lobbying work  
  - Community Organizing and Coalitions: grassroots movement building  
  - Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation: starting new ventures or hybrid models  
  - International and Global Nonprofit Management: working with NGOs outside your home country
