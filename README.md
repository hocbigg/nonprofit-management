# Summary

The Nonprofit Management curriculum is a **complete education in Nonprofit Management** using online materials.

## Organization

This repository is organized into 2 main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

Study them **in this exact order**:

1. **Foundations of the Nonprofit Sector**  
   Start here. This section explains what the nonprofit world actually is.

2. **Governance, Law, and Ethics**  
   Next. You need to understand who is legally and ethically responsible for running a nonprofit.

3. **Financial and Human Systems**  
   After governance, learn how nonprofits handle money and people — two areas that determine whether an organization survives.

4. **External Relations and Resource Development**  
   Finally (of the core), study how nonprofits bring in the money and build relationships with the outside world.
