## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

Study them **in this exact order**:

1. **I. Foundations of the Nonprofit Sector**  
   Start here. This section explains what the nonprofit world actually is.

2. **II. Governance, Law, and Ethics**  
   Next. You need to understand who is legally and ethically responsible for running a nonprofit.

3. **III. Financial and Human Systems**  
   After governance, learn how nonprofits handle money and people — two areas that determine whether an organization survives.

4. **V. External Relations and Resource Development**  
   Finally (of the core), study how nonprofits bring in the money and build relationships with the outside world.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections are deeper or more directional. You do **not** need to study all of them. Pick 1–3 tracks that match your interests, career goals, or the type of nonprofit work you want to do.

- **IV. Programs, Evaluation, and Impact**  
  Best for people interested in designing, running, and measuring the actual programs and services nonprofits deliver.

- **VI. Strategy, Leadership, and Organizational Change**  
  Ideal if you want to understand (or eventually become) an executive director, lead major change, or help organizations grow and adapt.

- **VII. Specialized and Adjacent Domains**  
  This is a collection of focused topics. Choose the ones most relevant to you:  

  - Volunteer Management: organizations that rely heavily on volunteers  
  - Advocacy, Public Policy, and Government Relations: policy change or lobbying work  
  - Community Organizing and Coalitions: grassroots movement building  
  - Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation: starting new ventures or hybrid models  
  - International and Global Nonprofit Management: working with NGOs outside your home country
